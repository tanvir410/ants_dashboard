! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned a VPN Connection Identifier
! and is associated with two other identifiers, namely the
! Customer Gateway Identifier and the Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
!
! Your VPN Connection ID 		    : vpn-123456789abc12345
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID   : vgw-00112233aabbcc112
! Your Customer Gateway ID		    : cgw-abcabcabc12312312
!
! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
! configured on your Customer Gateway.
!
! This configuration was tested on a Watchguard device
!

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! IPSec Tunnel #1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption,
! authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key parameters.
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups
! like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
!
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
! To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
! If not behind NAT, we recommend disabling NAT-T.
!
! Create IKE (Phase 1) Gateway:
Go to VPN-->BOVPN Virtual Interfaces-->Click on the 'Lock' button to make changes-->Click ADD

 Interface Name: vpn-123456789abc12345-1
 Remote Endpoint Type: Cloud VPN or Third-Party Gateway

	Gateway Settings-->Credential Method:

		Use Pre-Shared Key: <pre-shared-key>

	Gateway Settings-->Gateway Endpoint-->Click ADD:

		Select Local Gateway-->Interface:
			a. Physical: External

		Select Local Gateway-->Specify the gateway ID for tunnel authentication:
			a. By IP address: <your-cgw-ip-address>

		Select Remote Gateway-->Specify the remote gateway IP address for a tunnel:
			a. Static IP address: <AWS_ENDPOINT_1>

		Select Remote Gateway-->Specify the remote gateway ID for tunnel authentication:
			a. By IP Address: <AWS_ENDPOINT_1>

		Select Advanced-->Click OK

	Check 'Start Phase1 tunnel when it is inactive'
  ! Keep the 'Add this tunnel to the BOVPN-Allow policies' checked.

	Phase 1 Settings:
		1. Version: IKEv1
		2. Mode: Main
		3. Uncheck NAT Traversal
  ! NAT Traversal is enabled by default but if your WatchGuard device is not behind a NAT/PAT device, please deselect NAT Traversal.
		4. Dead Peer Detection:
			a. Traffic idle timeout: 10
			b. Max retries: 3

	Transform Settings-->Click ADD:
		1. Authentication: SHA1
		2. Encryption: AES(128-bit)
		3. SA Life: 8 hours
		4. Key Group: Diffie-Hellman Group 2

		Click OK
! Remove any pre-existing Phase 1 Transform Settings eg. SHA1-3DES

Click SAVE

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #2: IPSec Configuration
!
! The IPSec transform set defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
! mode parameters.
!
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
!
! Create IPSEC (Phase 2) Proposal:
Go to VPN-->Phase2 Proposals-->Click ADD:

	 1. Name: AWS-ESP-AES128-SHA1
	 2. Description: AWS Phase 2 Proposal
	 3. Type: ESP
	 4. Authentication: SHA1
	 5. Encryption: AES(128-bit)
	 6. Force Key Expiration: Select 'Time' -> 1 hours

Click SAVE

Go to VPN-->BOVPN Virtual Interfaces-->Select vpn-123456789abc12345-1-->Click EDIT

	Phase 2 Settings-->Perfect Forward Secrecy:
		Check 'Enable Perfect Forward Secrecy': Diffie-Hellman Group 2

	IPSec Proposals-->Click on existing proposal-->Click REMOVE
		Select 'AWS-ESP-AES128-SHA1' from the drop-down menu-->Click ADD

Click SAVE

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #3: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Configuration
!
! BGP is used within the tunnel to exchange prefixes between the
! Virtual Private Gateway and your Customer Gateway. The Virtual Private Gateway
! will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
!
!
! The BGP timers are adjusted to provide more rapid detection of outages.
!
! The local BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) (65000) is configured
! as part of your Customer Gateway. If the ASN must be changed, the
! Customer Gateway and VPN Connection will need to be recreated with AWS.
!

	Interface:
! Keep 'Assign virtual interface IP addresses' option checked
	   a. Local IP address: 169.254.225.142

Click on 'BGP':
  Check 'Enable'

! Add the below BGP dynamic routing configuration commands in the box:

router bgp 65000    -- Use this command only once at the beginning of the BGP config.
!                      Do not repeat this command for the second BGP neighbor

neighbor 169.254.225.141 activate
neighbor 169.254.225.141 timers 10 30
!
! To advertise additional prefixes to Amazon VPC, copy the 'network' statement
! and  identify the prefixes you wish to advertise. Make sure the prefix is present
! in the routing table of the device with a valid next-hop. Your Customer Gateway
! may announce a default route (0.0.0.0/0)
!
! network 0.0.0.0/0
