# Amazon Web Services
# Virtual Private Cloud

# AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manage the configuration of
# a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is
# associated with two other identifiers, namely the
# Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
#
# Your VPN Connection ID  		    : vpn-123456789abc12345
# Your Virtual Private Gateway ID           : vgw-00112233aabbcc112
# Your Customer Gateway ID 		    : cgw-abcabcabc12312312
#
#
# This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
# configured on your Customer Gateway.
#


# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IPSec Tunnel #1
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
#
# A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption,
# authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key parameters.
#
# Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
# Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
# You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
# NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
#
# Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
# The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
# Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
# To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall !rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
| If not behind NAT, and you are not using an Accelerated VPN, we recommend disabling NAT-T. If you are using an Accelerated VPN, make sure that NAT-T is enabled.

	ipsec ike hash 1 sha

# This line stores the Pre Shared Key used to authenticate the
# tunnel endpoints.

	ipsec ike pre-shared-key 1 text <pre-shared-key>

# #2: IPSec Configuration

# The IPSec policy defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
# mode parameters.
# Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
# Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
# NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
#
# Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
#

# Note that there are a global list of IPSec policies, each identified by
# sequence number. This policy is defined as #201, which may conflict with
# an existing policy using the same number. If so, we recommend changing
# the sequence number to avoid conflicts.

# Additional parameters of the IPSec configuration are set here. Note that
# these parameters are global and therefore impact other IPSec
# associations.
# This option instructs the router to clear the "Don't Fragment"
# bit from packets that carry this bit and yet must be fragmented, enabling
# them to be fragmented.
#
	ipsec tunnel outer df-bit clear

# This option enables IPSec Dead Peer Detection, which causes periodic
# messages to be sent to ensure a Security Association remains operational.

      	ipsec ike keepalive use 1 on dpd 10 3

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
#
# A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated
# with the tunnel. All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be
# encrypted and transmitted to the VPC. Similarly, traffic from the VPC
# will be logically received on this interface.
#
# The address of the interface is configured with the setup for your
# Customer Gateway.  If the address changes, the Customer Gateway and VPN
# Connection must be recreated with Amazon VPC.
#
	ipsec ike local address 1 <your-cgw-ip-address>

# If you are using NAT(IP masquerade) on this device, then you should specify the private IP address for the argument:
# ipsec ike local address  <CGW local IP address>
# Please specify the same local IP address for the 'nat descriptor masquerade' commands:
# nat descriptor address inner 1  <CGW local IP address range>
# nat descriptor masquerade static 1 1 <CGW local IP address>  udp 500
# nat descriptor masquerade static 1 2 <CGW local IP address>  esp *

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# #4: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Configuration
#
# BGP is used within the tunnel to exchange prefixes between the
# Virtual Private Gateway and your Customer Gateway. The Virtual Private Gateway
# will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
#
# The BGP timers are adjusted to provide more rapid detection of outages.
#
# The local BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) (65000) is configured
# as part of your Customer Gateway. If the ASN must be changed, the
# Customer Gateway and VPN Connection will need to be recreated with AWS.

# To advertise additional prefixes to Amazon VPC, copy the 'import filter' statement and
# identify the prefix you wish to advertise. Make sure the
# prefix is present in the routing table of the device with a valid next-hop.
# For example, the following two lines will advertise 192.168.0.0/16 and 10.0.0.0/16 to Amazon VPC
#
# bgp import filter 1 equal 10.0.0.0/16
