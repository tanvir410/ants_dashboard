! Amazon Web Services
! Virtual Private Cloud

! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is
! associated with two other identifiers, namely the
! Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
!
! Your VPN Connection ID                  : vpn-123456789abc12345
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID         : vgw-00112233aabbcc112
! Your Customer Gateway ID                : cgw-abcabcabc12312312
!
!
! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
! configured on your Customer Gateway for a redundant setup
!
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! IPSec Tunnel #1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption, authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime,
! and key parameters.The IKE peer is configured with the supported IKE encryption,  authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key
! parameters.Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256,  or other DH
! groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT). To
! ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall rules to unblock UDP port 4500.

!Note: For some versions:You might need to remove the default policy supporting MD5 and DES or other unsupported encryption/hashing algorithms.

	group2
	lifetime 28800
	no natt
	dpd
	dpd-interval 15
	activate
exit

!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #3: IPSec Configuration
!
! The crypto map defines the  IPSec transform set and other IPsec parameters .
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 1,2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".

! Configure your device to ignore any "Don't Fragment" bit set in the packets that carry this bit and yet must be fragmented ,enabling
! them to be fragmented. Please note that the below configuration is global and affects other IPsec associations as well

crypto ignore-df-bit

!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!
! A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated with the tunnel.
! All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be encrypted and transmitted to the VPC.
! Similarly, traffic from the VPC will be logically received on this interface.
!
! You need to set the ping check Period, Timeout and Fail Tolerance to check if the tunnel is up, for failover of traffic between tunnels.
! Period is number of seconds between pings. Timeout is number of seconds to wait for a response before the attempt is a failure.
! Fail Tolerance is the number of consecutive failures the Zyxel gateway remove routing on this tunnel interface, and the routing on the
! second tunnel interface will become active.
! Using the respective values of 5, 3 and 2, your tunnel will failover in 10 seconds.
!

interface vti0

  ping-check 169.254.225.141 method icmp period 5 timeout 3 fail-tolerance 2
  no shutdown
exit

! Association tunnel interface with the IPSec security association is done through the
! "binding interface" command.

binding interface vti0 crypto-map amazon-ipsec-vpn-123456789abc12345-0

! Tunnel interface needs to be associated to Zone, we are using IPSec_VPN zone as an example, please adjust accordingly.

zone IPSec_VPN
  interface vti0
exit

! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #4 Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Configuration
!
! BGP is used within the tunnel to exchange prefixes between the
! Virtual Private Gateway and your Customer Gateway. The Virtual Private Gateway
! will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
!
!
! The local BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) (65000)
! is configured as part of your Customer Gateway. If the ASN must
! be changed, the Customer Gateway and VPN Connection will need to be recreated with AWS.
!
!Please advertise prefixes on the BGP for second tunnel by using attributes such as AS-PATH prepend in order to prefer one tunnel at a time and avaoid any issues caused due to asymmetric routing.
! Your Customer Gateway may announce a default route (0.0.0.0/0) to us or advertise your specific LAN prefixes over BGP.
