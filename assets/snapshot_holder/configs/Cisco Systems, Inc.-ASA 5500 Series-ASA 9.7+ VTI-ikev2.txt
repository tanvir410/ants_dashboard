! Amazon Web Services
! Virtual Private Cloud

! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is
! associated with two other identifiers, namely the
! Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
!
! Your VPN Connection ID                  : vpn-123456789abc12345
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID         : vgw-00112233aabbcc112
! Your Customer Gateway ID		  : cgw-abcabcabc12312312
!
!
! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
! configured on your Customer Gateway.
!




! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! IPSec Tunnel #1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption,
! authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key parameters.
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
! To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall !rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
| If not behind NAT, and you are not using an Accelerated VPN, we recommend disabling NAT-T. If you are using an Accelerated VPN, make sure that NAT-T is enabled.
!
! Note that there are a global list of ISAKMP policies, each identified by
! sequence number. This policy is defined as #200, which may conflict with
! an existing policy using the same number. If so, we recommend changing
! the sequence number to avoid conflicts.
!

! This is a Route Based Configuration Example.

! First, enable IKEv2 on the outside interface and configure the IKEv2 policies.

crypto ikev2 enable outside

crypto ikev2 policy 200
  encryption aes
  group 2
  integrity sha
  lifetime seconds 28800
exit

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #2: IPSec Configuration
!
! The IPSec transform set defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
! mode parameters.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
!
crypto ipsec ikev2 ipsec-proposal SET1
  protocol esp encryption aes
  protocol esp integrity sha-1
exit

!Configure IPSEC Profile which will be used in the Tunnel Configuration.

crypto ipsec profile PROFILE1
  set ikev2 ipsec-proposal SET1
  set pfs group2
  set security-association lifetime seconds 3600
exit

! Additional parameters of the IPSec configuration are set here. Note that
! these parameters are global and therefore impact other IPSec
! associations.
! This option instructs the router to clear the "Don't Fragment"
! bit from packets that carry this bit and yet must be fragmented, enabling
! them to be fragmented.
!
!You will need to replace the outside_interface with the interface name of your ASA Firewall.

crypto ipsec df-bit clear-df <outside_interface>


! This option causes the firewall to reduce the Maximum Segment Size of TCP packets to prevent packet fragmentation.

sysopt connection tcpmss 1379


! This configures the gateway's window for accepting out of order IPSec packets. A larger window can be helpful if too many packets are dropped due to reordering while in transit between gateways.


crypto ipsec security-association replay window-size 128

! This option instructs the router to fragment the unencrypted packets (prior to encryption).
!You will need to replace the outside_interface with the interface name of your ASA Firewall.


crypto ipsec fragmentation before-encryption <outside_interface>

! The tunnel group sets the Pre Shared Key used to authenticate the tunnel endpoints.

group-policy AWS internal
group-policy AWS attributes
  vpn-tunnel-protocol ikev2
tunnel-group <AWS_ENDPOINT_1> type ipsec-l2l
tunnel-group <AWS_ENDPOINT_1> general-attributes

tunnel-group <AWS_ENDPOINT_1> ipsec-attributes
  ikev2 remote-authentication pre-shared-key <pre-shared-key>
  ikev2 local-authentication pre-shared-key <pre-shared-key>

! This option enables IPSec Dead Peer Detection, which causes semi-periodic
! messages to be sent to ensure a Security Association remains operational.
!
isakmp keepalive threshold 10 retry 10
			
exit

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!
! A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated
! with the tunnel. All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be
! encrypted and transmitted to the VPC. Similarly, traffic from the VPC
! will be logically received on this interface.
!
! Association with the IPSec security association is done through the
! "tunnel protection" command.
!
! The address of the interface is configured with the setup for your
! Customer Gateway.  If the address changes, the Customer Gateway and VPN
! Connection must be recreated with Amazon VPC.
!
!You will need to replace the outside_interface with the interface name of your ASA Firewall.



interface tunnel 100
 nameif vti-interface
 ip address 169.254.225.142 255.255.255.252
 tunnel source interface <outside_interface>
 tunnel destination <AWS_ENDPOINT_1>
 tunnel mode ipsec ipv4
 tunnel protection ipsec profile PROFILE1
 no shutdown
exit

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

! #4: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Configuration
!
! BGP is used within the tunnel to exchange prefixes between the
! Virtual Private Gateway and your Customer Gateway. The Virtual Private Gateway
! will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
!
! Your Customer Gateway may announce a default route (0.0.0.0/0),
! which can be done with the 'network' and 'default-originate' statements.
!
! The BGP timers are adjusted to provide more rapid detection of outages.
!
! The local BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) (65000) is configured
! as part of your Customer Gateway. If the ASN must be changed, the
! Customer Gateway and VPN Connection will need to be recreated with AWS.
!

! 'Network' command will be used here to advertised CGW network to AWS via BGP. An example for a CGW with the prefix 192.168.100.0/24 is provided below:

router bgp 65000
  bgp log-neighbor-changes
  bgp graceful-restart
    address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 169.254.225.141 remote-as 64512
    neighbor 169.254.225.141 timers 10 30 30
    neighbor 169.254.225.141 ebgp-multihop 255
    neighbor 169.254.225.141 activate
    network 192.168.100.0 mask 255.255.255.0
