! Amazon Web Services
! Virtual Private Cloud

! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is
! associated with two other identifiers, namely the
! Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
!
! Your VPN Connection ID 		  : vpn-123456789abc12345
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID         : vgw-00112233aabbcc112
! Your Customer Gateway ID		  : cgw-abcabcabc12312312
!
!
! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
! configured on your Customer Gateway.
!
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! IPSec Tunnel #1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption,
! authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key parameters.
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
! To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall !rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
| If not behind NAT, and you are not using an Accelerated VPN, we recommend disabling NAT-T. If you are using an Accelerated VPN, make sure that NAT-T is enabled.
!

Go to network Tab-->IKE Crypto, create new IKE crypto

 a. Name: vpn-123456789abc12345-0
 b. DH Group: group 2
 c. Authentication: sha1
 d. Encryption: aes128
 e. Lifetime: 28800 seconds


Create IKE Gateway:
Go to network tab--> IKE Gateway, create a new IKE Gateway

 a. Name: ike-vpn-123456789abc12345-0
 b. Interface: select your "WAN" interface
 c. Peer type: Static
 d. Peer IP address: <AWS_ENDPOINT_1>
 e. pre-shared-key: <pre-shared-key>
 f. Select Advanced:
   1. Exchange mode: main
   2. IKE Crypto Profile: Choose vpn-123456789abc12345-0
   3. Dead Peer Detection: interval-10, retry-3



! #2: IPSec Configuration
!
! The IPSec transform set defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
! mode parameters.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
!

Go to network tab--> IPSec Crypto, and create new IPSec crypto.

 a. name: ipsec-vpn-123456789abc12345-0
 b. Encryption: aes128
 c. Authentication: sha1
 d. DH Group: 2
 e. Lifetime: 3600 seconds


! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!
! A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated
! with the tunnel. All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be
! encrypted and transmitted to the VPC. Similarly, traffic from the VPC
! will be logically received on this interface.
!
!
! The address of the interface is configured with the setup for your
! Customer Gateway.  If the address changes, the Customer Gateway and VPN
! Connection must be recreated with Amazon VPC.
!



Go to network tab-->interface, and create a new tunnel interface.

 a. Name: tunnel.1
 b. Virtual Router: Select your Virtual router
 c. IP Address: 169.254.225.142/30
 d. MTU: 1427
 e. Security Zone: put the tunnel in the appropriate zone.


Go to Network Tab-->Ipsec tunnels, and create a new IPsec tunnel.

 a. Name: ipsec-tunnel-1
 b. Tunnel interface: tunnel.1
 c. Type: Auto Key
 d. IKE Gateway: ike-vpn-123456789abc12345-0
 e. IPSec Crypto profile: ipsec-vpn-123456789abc12345-0
 f. Check Show Advanced options
 g. Check Enable Replay Protection.

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

! #4: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Configuration
!
! BGP is used within the tunnel to exchange prefixes between the
! Virtual Private Gateway and your Customer Gateway. The Virtual Private Gateway
! will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
!
!
!
! The local BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) (65000)
! is configured as part of your Customer Gateway. If the ASN must
! be changed, the Customer Gateway and VPN Connection will need to be recreated with AWS.
! The BGP keepalive and hold-down timer values should be 10 and 30 seconds respectively.

Go to network tab--> select virtual-router. Select the necessary virtual-router.
Select BGP.

1. General tab:
 a. Check Enable.
 b. Router-ID: <your-cgw-ip-address>
 c. AS number: 65000


2. In Peer Group tab, create new peer-group
 a. Name: AmazonBGP
 b. Check Enable
 c. Type: EBGP
 d. Add new peer:
   i. Name: amazon-vpn-123456789abc12345-0
   ii. Check Enable
   iii. Peer AS: 64512
   iv. Local address:
      1. Interface: tunnel. vpn-123456789abc12345-0
      2. IP: 169.254.225.142
   v. Peer IP address:
      1. IP: 169.254.225.141
   vi. Click ok

! Your Customer Gateway may announce a default route (0.0.0.0/0) to us. This is done as follows:

3. Under Export rule, create new rule:
 a. Under General tab:
   i. Name: Export_to_Amazon
   ii. Used By: AmazonBGP

 b. Under Match tab:
   i. Add a new address prefix 0.0.0.0/0, and check exact.

! To advertise additional prefixes to Amazon VPC, add these prefixes to the 'address-prefix'
! statement and identify the prefix you wish to advertise. Make sure the prefix is present
! in the routing table of the device with a valid next-hop. If you want to advertise
! 192.168.0.0/16 to Amazon, this can be done using the following.

4. Under Export rule, create new rule:
  a. Under General tab:
    i. Name: Export_to_Amazon
