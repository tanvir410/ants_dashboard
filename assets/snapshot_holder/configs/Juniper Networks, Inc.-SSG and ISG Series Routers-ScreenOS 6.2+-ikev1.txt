# Amazon Web Services
# Virtual Private Cloud
#
# AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
# a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned a VPN Connection Identifier
# and is associated with two other identifiers, namely the
# Customer Gateway Identifier and the Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
#
# Your VPN Connection ID 		    : vpn-123456789abc12345
# Your Virtual Private Gateway ID           : vgw-00112233aabbcc112
# Your Customer Gateway ID		    : cgw-abcabcabc12312312
#
# This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
# configured on your Customer Gateway.
#
# This configuration was tested on a Juniper SSG-5 running ScreenOS 6.3R11.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IPSec Tunnel #1
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
#
# A proposal is established for the supported IKE encryption,
# authentication, Diffie-Hellman, and lifetime parameters.
# Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
# Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
# You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
# NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
#
# Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
# The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
# Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
# To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
| If not behind NAT, and you are not using an Accelerated VPN, we recommend disabling NAT-T. If you are using an Accelerated VPN, make sure that NAT-T is enabled.

# associated with.
# This address is configured with the setup for your Customer Gateway.

# To do so, run the following commands:

# Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.

# Your Customer Gateway may announce a default route (0.0.0.0/0).
#
# The BGP timers are adjusted to provide more rapid detection of outages.
