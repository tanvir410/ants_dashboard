! Amazon Web Services
! Virtual Private Cloud

! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is
! associated with two other identifiers, namely the
! Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
!
! Your VPN Connection ID 		  : vpn-123456789abc12345
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID         : vgw-00112233aabbcc112
! Your Customer Gateway ID		  : cgw-abcabcabc12312312
!
!
! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
! configured on your Customer Gateway.
!
! You may need to populate these values throughout the config based on your setup:
! <interface_name/private_IP_on_outside_interface> - External interface of the CSR

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! IPSec Tunnel #1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption,
! authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key parameters.
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
! To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall !rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
| If not behind NAT, and you are not using an Accelerated VPN, we recommend disabling NAT-T. If you are using an Accelerated VPN, make sure that NAT-T is enabled.
!
! Note that there are a global list of ISAKMP policies, each identified by
! sequence number. This policy is defined as #200, which may conflict with
! an existing policy using the same number. If so, we recommend changing
! the sequence number to avoid conflicts.

! #2: IPSec Configuration
!
! The IPSec transform set defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
! mode parameters.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".

! Additional parameters of the IPSec configuration are set here. Note that
! these parameters are global and therefore impact other IPSec
! associations.
! This option instructs the router to clear the "Don't Fragment"
! bit from packets that carry this bit and yet must be fragmented, enabling
! them to be fragmented.

! If you are using Accelerated AWS VPN, please configure periodic Dead Peer Detection.

! This option instructs the router to fragment the unencrypted packets

! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!
! A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated
! with the tunnel. All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be
! encrypted and transmitted to the VPC. Similarly, traffic from the VPC
! will be logically received on this interface.
!
! Association with the IPSec security association is done through the
! "tunnel protection" command.
!
! The address of the interface is configured with the setup for your
! Customer Gateway.  If the address changes, the Customer Gateway and VPN
! Connection must be recreated with Amazon VPC.
!

  ! TCP packets to prevent packet fragmentation.

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

! #4: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Configuration
!
! BGP is used within the tunnel to exchange prefixes between the
! Virtual Private Gateway and your Customer Gateway. The Virtual Private Gateway
! will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
!
! Your Customer Gateway may announce a default route (0.0.0.0/0),
! which can be done with the 'network' and 'default-originate' statements.
!
! The BGP timers are adjusted to provide more rapid detection of outages.
!
! The local BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) (65000) is configured
! as part of your Customer Gateway. If the ASN must be changed, the
! Customer Gateway and VPN Connection will need to be recreated with AWS.
!
! 'Network' command will be used here to advertised CGW network to AWS via BGP. An example for a CGW with the prefix 192.168.100.0/24 is provided below:

router bgp 65000
  bgp log-neighbor-changes
