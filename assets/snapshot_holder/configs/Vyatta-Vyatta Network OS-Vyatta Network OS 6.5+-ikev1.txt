! Amazon Web Services
! Virtual Private Cloud

! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is
! associated with two other identifiers, namely the
! Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
!
! Your VPN Connection ID                  : vpn-123456789abc12345
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID         : vgw-00112233aabbcc112
! Your Customer Gateway ID                : cgw-abcabcabc12312312
!
!
! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
! configured on your Customer Gateway.
!
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! IPSec Tunnel #1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption,
! authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key parameters.
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
! To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall !rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
| If not behind NAT, and you are not using an Accelerated VPN, we recommend disabling NAT-T. If you are using an Accelerated VPN, make sure that NAT-T is enabled.

set vpn ipsec site-to-site peer <AWS_ENDPOINT_1> vti esp-group 'AWS'


! #2: IPSec Configuration
!
! The IPSec (Phase 2) proposal defines the protocol, authentication,
! encryption, and lifetime parameters for our IPSec security association.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".

! This option enables IPSec Dead Peer Detection, which causes periodic
! messages to be sent to ensure a Security Association remains operational.

set vpn ipsec ike-group AWS dead-peer-detection interval '15'
set vpn ipsec ike-group AWS dead-peer-detection timeout '30'

! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!
!  The tunnel interface is configured with the internal IP address.

set interfaces vti vti0 address '169.254.225.142/30'
set interfaces vti vti0 description 'VPC tunnel 1'
set interfaces vti vti0 mtu '1436'

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

! #4: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Configuration
!
! BGP is used within the tunnel to exchange prefixes between the
! Virtual Private Gateway and your Customer Gateway. The Virtual Private Gateway
! will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
!
! Your Customer Gateway may announce a default route (0.0.0.0/0),
! which can be done with the 'network' statement.
!
! The BGP timers are adjusted to provide more rapid detection of outages.
!
! The local BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) (65000) is configured
! as part of your Customer Gateway. If the ASN must be changed, the
! Customer Gateway and VPN Connection will need to be recreated with AWS.
!

! To advertise additional prefixes to Amazon VPC, replace the 0.0.0.0/0 from the
! the following line with the prefix you wish to advertise. Make sure the prefix is present
! in the routing table of the device with a valid next-hop.
