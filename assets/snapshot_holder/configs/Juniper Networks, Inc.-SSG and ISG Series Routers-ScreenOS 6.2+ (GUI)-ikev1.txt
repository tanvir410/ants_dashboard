# Amazon Web Services
# Virtual Private Cloud
#
# AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
# a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned a VPN Connection Identifier
# and is associated with two other identifiers, namely the
# Customer Gateway Identifier and the Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
#
# Your VPN Connection ID 		    : vpn-123456789abc12345
# Your Virtual Private Gateway ID           : vgw-00112233aabbcc112
# Your Customer Gateway ID		    : cgw-abcabcabc12312312
#
# This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
# configured on your Customer Gateway.
#
# This configuration was tested on a Juniper SSG-5 running ScreenOS 6.3R11.
#

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IPSec Tunnel #1
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# #1: Tunnel Interface Configuration
# The tunnel interface is configured with the internal IP address.
#
# To establish connectivity between your internal network and the VPC, you
# must have an interface facing your internal network in the "Trust" zone.
#
#

Expand Network -> Interfaces -> List
On the Right Top corner, select "Tunnel IF" and click New

 a. Tunnel Interface Name: tunnel.1
 b. Zone (VR): Trust
 c. Select Fixed IP -> IP Address / Netmask: 169.254.225.142/30
 d. Maximum Transfer Unit(MTU) Admin MTU: 1436
Click OK

# By default, the router will block asymmetric VPN traffic, which may occur
# with this VPN Connection. This occurs, for example, when routing policies
# cause traffic to sent from your router to VPC through one IPSec tunnel
# while traffic returns from VPC through the other.
#
# In order to allow asymmetric routing over VPN, enable "asymmetric-vpn" on
# the tunnel interface zone

Expand Network -> Zones -> Click Edit for Trust Zone
Select Asymmetric VPN
Click OK

# This option causes the router to reduce the Maximum Segment Size of
# TCP packets to prevent packet fragmentation.
#
# This command has to be entered via the CLI

set flow vpn-tcp-mss 1387


# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# #2: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
#
# A proposal is established for the supported IKE encryption,
# authentication, Diffie-Hellman, and lifetime parameters.
# Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
# Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
# You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
# NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
#
# Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
# The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
# Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
# To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
| If not behind NAT, and you are not using an Accelerated VPN, we recommend disabling NAT-T. If you are using an Accelerated VPN, make sure that NAT-T is enabled.

# Troubleshooting IKE connectivity can be aided by enabling IKE debugging.
# To do so, run the following commands on the CLI:

# encryption, and lifetime parameters for our IPSec security association.
# Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
# Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.

# will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
#
#
# The BGP timers are adjusted to provide more rapid detection of outages.
