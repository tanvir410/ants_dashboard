! Amazon Web Services
! Virtual Private Cloud

! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is
! associated with two other identifiers, namely the
! Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
!
! Your VPN Connection ID      : vpn-123456789abc12345
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID  : vgw-00112233aabbcc112
! Your Customer Gateway ID      : cgw-abcabcabc12312312
!
!
! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
! configured on your Customer Gateway.
!
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! IPSec Tunnel #1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption,
! authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key parameters.
! Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256, or other DH groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
!
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT).
! To ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
| If not behind NAT, and you are not using an Accelerated VPN, we recommend disabling NAT-T. If you are using an Accelerated VPN, make sure that NAT-T is enabled.
!
! Configuration begins in root VDOM.


Go to VPN-->IPSec--> AutoKey, create Phase 1

 a. Name: vpn-123456789abc12345-0 ! Name must be shorter than 15 chars, best if shorter than 12
 b. Remote Gateway: Static IP Address
 c. IP address: <AWS_ENDPOINT_1>
 d. Local Interface: wan1
 e. Mode: Main
 f. Authentication Method: Pre-shared Key
 g. Pre-Shared Key: <pre-shared-key>

 Select Advanced:
 h. Ike Version: 1
 i. Local-gateway: Select Specify and enter <your-cgw-ip-address>
 j. Encryption: aes128
 k. Authentication: sha1
 l. DH group: 2
 m. Keylife: 28800 seconds
 n. Select  Dead Peer Detection Enable
 j. Click ok




! #2: IPSec Configuration
!
! The IPSec transform set defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
! mode parameters.
!
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".

Go to VPN-->IPSec--> AutoKey, create Phase 2

 a. Name: vpn-123456789abc12345-0 ! Name must be shorter than 15 chars, best if shorter than 12
 b. Phase 1:  vpn-123456789abc12345-0

Select Advanced

 c. Encryption: aes128
 d. Authentication: sha1
 e. Select Enable Replay Detection
 f. Select Perfect Forward Secrecy
 g. DH Group: 2
 h. Keylife: 3600 seconds
 i. Click Ok


! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #3: Tunnel Interface Configuration
!  
! A tunnel interface is configured to be the logical interface associated  
! with the tunnel. All traffic routed to the tunnel interface will be 
! encrypted and transmitted to the VPC. Similarly, traffic from the VPC
! will be logically received on this interface.
!
!
! The address of the interface is configured with the setup for your 
! Customer Gateway.  If the address changes, the Customer Gateway and VPN 
! Connection must be recreated with Amazon VPC.
!
! This is required in order for tunnel failover via gwtect to function
! Perform this from the Global VDOM.

Go to System Tab --> Network --> Interface --> wan1 and edit vpn-123456789abc12345-0

 a. Name: Tunnel. Tunnel1
 b. IP : 169.254.225.142
 c. Remote IP: 169.254.225.141
 d. Select Ping
 e. Administrative Status: Up
 f. Select Ok.

You can set MTU and MSS on the tunnel by:
 config system interface
  edit "vpn-123456789abc12345-0"
    set mtu 1427
    set tcp-mss 1379
   next



! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #4: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Configuration
!
! BGP is used within the tunnel to exchange prefixes between the
! Virtual Private Gateway and your Customer Gateway. The Virtual Private Gateway
! will announce the prefix corresponding to your VPC.
!
! The local BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) (65000)
! is configured as part of your Customer Gateway. If the ASN must
! be changed, the Customer Gateway and VPN Connection will need to be recreated with AWS.
!
! Perform this from root VDOM.

Go to Router Tab --> Dynamic --> BGP

 a. Local-AS : 65000
 b. Router-ID: <your-cgw-ip-address>
 c. Neighbor:
    i. Check Enable.
    ii. Router-ID: <your-cgw-ip-address>
    iii. AS number: 65000
    iv. Under the Neighbors tab:
      1.   IP:  169.254.225.141 ! Local Subnet/Mask you wish to advertise
      2.  Remote AS: 64512
      3. Click Add


! Your Customer Gateway may announce a default route (0.0.0.0/0) to us. This needs to be done in the CLI using:

config router bgp
 config neighbor
  edit 169.254.225.141
   set capability-default-originate enable
   end
 end

config router prefix-list
   edit "default_route"
     config rule
      edit 1
       set prefix 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
      next
     end
    set router-id <your-cgw-ip-address>
end

config router route-map
     edit "routemap1"
     config rule
        edit 1
        set match-ip-address "default_route"
        next
     end
  next
end

! To advertise additional prefixes to Amazon VPC, add these prefixes to the 'address-prefix'
! statement and identify the prefix you wish to advertise. Make sure the prefix is present
! in the routing table of the device with a valid next-hop. If you want to advertise
! 192.168.0.0/16 to Amazon, this can be done using the following.

 e. Under the Networks tab:
   i.  IP/Netmask: 192.168.0.0/16
   ii. Click Add

 f. Click Apply

! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #5: Firewall Policy Configuration
!
! Create a firewall policy permitting traffic from your local subnet to the VPC subnet and vice versa
! This example policy permits all traffic from the local subnet to the VPC.

Go to Firewall --> Policy --> Policy
1) Create New
   a. Source Interface/Zone = internal ! This is the interface out which your local LAN resides
   b. Source Address = all
   c. Destination Interface/Zone = "vpn-123456789abc12345-0"
   d. Destination Address = all
   e. Schedule = always
   f. Service = ANY
   g. Action = ACCEPT
   h. Click OK

! Now create a policy to permit traffic going the other way

2) Create New
   a. Source Interface/Zone = "vpn-123456789abc12345-0" ! This is the interface out which your local LAN resides
   b. Source Address = all
   c. Destination Interface/Zone = internal
   d. Destination Address = all
   e. Schedule = always
   f. Service = ANY
   g. Action = ACCEPT
   h. Click OK
